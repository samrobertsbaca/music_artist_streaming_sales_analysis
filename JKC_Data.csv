Oh My Love,Country Western Bar,9,"Will you take me in your arms to the country western bar?
Country western bar, take me in your arms
Will you take me in your arms and fly me to the stars
When we turn to dust upon the earth?

We could cure these blues in our country western shoes
Country western shoes, dance the whole night through
We could dance the whole night through until our feet are bruised
When we turn to dust upon the earth

I feel our love is burning in me like a coffee cup
Just like a coffee cup, darlin', we better drink it up
We better drink it up before it's cold as mud
When we turn to dust upon the earth

Will you walk along my side down the city streets tonight?
City streets tonight, darlin', walk it all my life
Will you walk it all my life into the morning light
When we turn to dust upon the earth?

You know the wintertime is coming, and I can feel it on the midst
I feel it on the midst, darlin', won't you take this kiss
Darlin' won't you take this kiss before it's in the ditch
When we turn to dust upon the earth

And the big black moon is rising in the heavy metal skies
Heavy metal skies, darlin', lord I don't know why but
I'm gonna love you 'till the day I die

Devil Rides Beside,Devil Rides Beside,9,"Sun's goin' down, 
Everybody knows it's time to go home
But my house burned to the ground, 
Mine is a pile of stick and stone
Summer breeze gonna break me down, 
Crying on the backyard porch
Devil rides beside me now, 
I never been so far off course
Tonight I give you all I own, 
a rusty spoon and a mortar shell
I won't be back tomorrow morn
But I hope this letter finds you well
If anybody asks you where I went, 
Tell em' they don't need to know
I just had to catch my breath, 
Look out thunder, here I roll

If you are sleeping, I won’t dare to wake you
Just keep on dreaming, hope the day don’t break you
I’ll keep believing that the lord can save you somehow
Damn it child, it’s a long way down

Walking on that beat down road, 
Where saints are made and men have died
And I'm thinking about Jesus, 
Wishing I was crucified
Forgive me big brother, 
Don't you know I'm terrified?
Tell mama that I love her, 
Tell Daddy that I'm on his side
I fell asleep in Dukeland,
Woke up down in Mexico
And I met a child of roses 
Giving away all he owned
Some folks carry their homes on their backs
Some folks carry so much worse
Devil rides beside me yet, but
Someday I will lift his curse

You're on the deep end
I am on the bayou
Once I was dreaming
But now I don't have time to
You keep on driving
No one's trying to find you now
Damn it child, you're a long way down

Yesterday the stars were shining
Today they're beaming black as hell
I thought I saw the final light
It was just another old motel
And a voice called as I stepped inside
Said, “what you think you’re doing here?”
I said, “I haven't slept in seventy miles,”
He said, “Rock me mama like a wagon wheel”
Now I'm back in the pouring naked rain
Shining shoes for pigs in sties
I made it to the Bitter End
And I never thought I'd be so high
But the hard part ain't the comedown
It's the climbing back up the hill
When the devil rides beside you
You either know it now, or soon you will

If you are weeping, I won't dare to shake you
If you should meet me, with open arms I'd brace you
My heart is breaking, don't you know I need you now
Damn it child, I'm a long way down",0:06:14,5/1/2020,bass guitar;pedal steel guitar;singing saw;trombone;drums;vocals;flute;electric guitar;acoustic guitar,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,americana;rock;folk;,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,QZDA82018398

In my daddy's snowshoes 
I'm in the tiger's jaws tonight 
And honey I'd come outside 
But the darkness, it feels too bright 
You peel your lemons, I roll the dice 
My hands are heavy,
But they're reaching toward the light

My guitar, it is broken
And my feet are burning 
And my walking shoes are wearing out 
And you tell me that the oil is drilled, and 
There's nobody left in doubt
I dance on the chimney 
Of the smokin' house 
And though the spirit’s in me, 
She's laughing 'round the bout

My hero's fallen, dead and forgotten 
And soon I'll be rotten too 
But still I'm gonna throw my chips 
On his broken record blues
One hand on the stick shift,
One foot on the moon
My head's in a whirlwind, 
And my soul is split in two

But I pray for paradise in Fantasy, Texas 
And I pray for sunshine on a sheet of ice
Sometimes I pray that it all turns out alright

Labyrinth of Faith,Labyrinth of Faith,1,"There is a calm before the storm, a peace before the war, a rose for every thorn
On the solid rock that's where I'll be reborn

No gust of wind or earthly whim could set me tumbling down that canyon floor
An unsubsiding hope that fortifies my trembling core

They call it faith, faith that could make it through the night
Faith in each step that it will take
Faith only god is gonna make things right

My lamp light's out the chilly wind whips young curses through the overgrowing plains
I cross my heart and watch it fly away

I'm roaring toward the shore unsure if tides will rise in troubled times that bind
Hope is on the run, I walk the plank and hope to die

'Cause I got faith, faith that i'm sinking like a ship
Faith I might drown in some abyss
Faith I'll be shrouded in an ocean crypt

Truth is truth no matter who or what or where or when or why it's speaking to or from
Truth is truth like water rushing, rising like the sun

And even if my friends forsake me, castigate me, feed me to their hungry hounds
I'll keep marching up to Zion 'till the walls come crashing down

With courageous fear and justified inaction reining 'neath a sullied sky
Leave me as I am or let me die

They say it's great to make mistakes then leave you at the stake before you ever try
Love me as I am or let the bloodshed multiply

'Cause you've got faith, faith that your world's about to break
Faith that you can take and take and take
Faith in shackles tethering you to freedom's gate

When all seems wrong you said once ""I am strong"", so don't forget that you were right
One day we'll sing an ode to endless dawn

When all goes wrong you sweet black swan go on go on your own path toward the light
And we shall ride in carriage horses drawn

And we'll have faith, faith in this mountain we must climb
Faith in the majesty up high
Faith that this little light of mine, it's gonna shine

There is a calm before the storm, a peace before the war, a rose for every thorn
On the solid rock that's where I'm still reborn

What is that sun it's something ancient bright and brilliant beaming in my mortal eye?
It is the candlestick, the wick of humankind

I stretch my hands out toward another ship another shore I'm sure my words can not define
A promised land defying race and creed, beyond the colored sky

That's where we'll walk in, hand-in-hand in understanding, peace and patience will survive
And someday in love, we'll meet again where roses never die

'Cause I got faith, faith that I'll make it through the night
Faith in each step that I shall take

Sometimes it's hopeless
But sometimes all we got
And I'm so glad I spent sometime with you

Now the earthquakes they may shake and the clouds may tumble
And the hurricanes might blow us into bits
And the terrorists, they may leave us in the rubble
That's fine 'cause darling, our love don't quit
Lovey baby, our love will win

And now I don't know where I am
Or where I been, or where I'll be

My once upon a time
I threw away my crystal ball
And now I walk the line

I saw a great distance,
A great distance,
A great missing you
But now I've gone that distance
I wish you'd gone there too

I used to think your love was all
And all was as it seemed
I saw you two-step through the wall
In my country western dreams

I saw the sun setting,
The sun setting
And I did not understand
That some things never settle,
They just drift like sand

Oh, my love
Oh, my love

As I fly toward the west

Shows me through the desperate land,
And leads me home?

Only a child of roses.

Who rows the boat
And needs no oar
Through the wind and cold
And greets the shore?

Who fights with hope
And wins the war?
Who gives the flower
And keeps its thorn?

When the road is lost and the feet have gone,

Devil Rides Beside,RV Park,4,"Darkness at the races, 
You looked so amazing, 
With your branded smile 
And a bread-knife in your hand

That's where I found salvation 
In the baseball celebration
You struck out before I even ran

On a midnight moon you told me 
Boy this life could be the only 
You better love me now or leave me while you can 

So while we can,
Let's go to the RV park, 
Hold each other close in the wandering dark 
I will be your one true star
You can trust me
How far to the meadowlark? 
How many miles till you break my heart?
Sometimes life is but a spark, 
And sometimes it's burning 

I met you in the trailer 
With the cowboy and the sailor
The sun went down, they left us for New York 

That's where you tried to woo me 
In the darkness like you knew me 
When I got up to leave you slammed the door 

Back then the world was young and easy 
And Father Time was but a feeling 
Now you're lost, I been losing it, and more 

And now I'm sure
Let's go to the RV park, 
Hold each other close in the wandering dark 
I will be your one true star 
You can trust me 
How far to the meadowlark? 
How many miles till you break my heart? 
Sometimes life is but a spark, 
And sometimes it's burning 

If the stars don't sing and the sun don't shine, you can trust me 
If God is truly on our side, you can trust me 
If hope is lost and death's on the line, you can trust me
I'll meet you on the borderline, you can trust me 
You can trust me
You can trust me
You can trust me

Born with little courage 
Frightened by the New Age 
Brought up by the fads and the funeral arts 

I wouldn't want to lose ya, 
My mutual medusa 
I think you and I could use another start 

In the cold and pointless weather 
I’m gonna march on toward forever 
I feel you now more than I ever did before 

And oh, my lord

Hold each other close in the wandering dark

720 Split,She Could Be Mine (feat. Split Philthy),2,"Commanding all attention
I see you 'cross the room
No space left to hide in
Under the milky moon
I can see their excitement
Gathering as people do
Let's escape this confinement
Honey can I ride with you?

I'm asking every question
I'm begging her to know
Everywhere she's gone
Everywhere she wants to go
I'm done looking for the answer
I can see it in your eyes
Now my heart's beating faster
Could she be mine?
Could she be mine?

She could, she could, she could, she could
She could, she could, she could,
She could be mine
She could be mine

It's an empty room it’s an empty room 
with no window and no view to you 
I put my leather strap cap on back
pack up and set my soul on my sleeve
back up and let my cold shoulder bleed
and as the red blood drops drip gleam
I fade to black like the end of a scene
and come back like awake from a dream
I stay fluid like the wake from a stream
I stay hot like the sun when it beams
Stay crack like the dope for the fiends
I mean it seems like, I mean it feels right. Right?

We leave the party early
I slip inside your car
We're searching every signal
For just one good bar
Swept up by emotion
Cmon' skinny lovin' arms
When the waitress says they're closing
We dance among the stars

We pull into the driveway
Sweet misty as the dew
And I'm wondering how to ask you
Just to stay a few
But long before you answer
You stumble to the door
You say, ""Lord, please forgive me""
As you hit the floor

Tongue in cheek, but it’s yours in mine
as I hold your tits and our legs entwine
and you hold my breath as I break inside
but I think of her as the angels cry
But you ride me like you could get away
but we stay the course underneath the shade
in an empty room mixing sex and sin
another jack and coke another juice and gin
we’re letting loose again (we’re running loose again)
and when the night is broken another day begins
we’re letting loose again another nooses end
as our necking cracks another pain begins

And she could, she could, she could, she could
She could, she could, she could,
She could be mine
No, She could be mine
She could be mine
No, She could be mine

Yeah she could, she could, she could, she could
She could, she could, she could,
She could be mine
No, She could be mine

She got 'em big blue eyes like morning skies
And a crescent smile just like the moon

She gotta wedding ring, and a bird that sings
When it sings ""I do,"" I sing ""I do too""
But the only bird I'm wanting to hear is you

She's coming down tonight, beaming oh so bright
She's coming down tonight, beaming oh so bright
She's my delight, my honeydew
She's coming down tonight for a sweet lovin' rendezvous

Rise over you and under through the distance
I wonder what you are,
Stuttering and frozen like an infant

Then at last, long last,
You ask me for a lighter, I didn't have one 
I looked inside your glass,
I saw what I wanted, and I lost ya 

But you don't find nobody else
Until you’ve found yourself
Into the wishing well,
I will tread light
I will tread light

Hunting for the docks, 
I disconnect the dots, my dreams of riches
I nearly lost you at the bog, 
I thought I saw a black dog stirring through the ditches 
Even the moon was getting on,
Too close to lose, too far off to hold onto it
When you sang me half that song,
Conjuring the language of the Wiccan

I loved you as a child,
Now I've been reguiled
But save your witching smile,
While I tread light
While I tread light

You know the closer I get to you, 
The farther out I find myself in Boulder 
They say the key of love is blue, 
In a dear, in a dance, in adieu, we all fall over 
But last night at the movies,
You slipped me something new, I felt a little bolder
When you came inside my room
I felt the black dog breathing down my shoulder

Inside those New Year's eyes 
I found no disguise 
You brush against my size 
But I tread light
I tread light

And all I want to do is:
Set fire, get higher, inspire you 
Hot on the merry-go-round 
Get down, run round in circles
Spread like a cancer 
And set off, get lost,
I wanna hop on the train, 
Get off on another
Find love, keep loving something
Just like Rolling Thunder
I wanna tap dance, 
I wanna make plans, 
I wanna take a stand 
And understand
I wanna hold hands, 
Make romance with you
Over and under
I wanna have faith, 
I wanna get saved, 
And maybe someday 
I'm gonna harken like an angel 
Remain unchained, 
Make change, 
Make a change,
And change,
And tread light
And tread light
And tread light
And tread light

Of course the sun, the sun
Cuts over through the tundras like a jackknife
Says ""It's done, it's done""
Now pack away your mids, your lows, your highlights
Though I might stumble through
The darkness for a moment or a lifetime
When eternity is through
I'll meet you singing half songs in the moonlight
