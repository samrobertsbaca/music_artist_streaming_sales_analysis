# Music Artist Streaming & Sales Analysis

## Project Intro/Objective

A project using Principal Component Analysis, Factor Analysis, and hypothesis testing to explore which songs perform the best in terms of streaming, sales, and artist-generated music characteristic data data for the musician "John King Cave".

## Project Description

In 2020, I released 31 songs of various genres under the stage name “John King Cave”. The data associated with these songs serves as the basis of our analysis.

A new, unsigned music artist who has a variety of genres of music released on various streaming services desires to know which of his songs perform the best in terms of streams and sales. What kind of music (in terms of genres / instruments used) should he produce next to generate the most revenue / streams?

This project will be of significance primarily for unsigned artists like myself who are interested in self-releasing their music online, and want to know how their music performs on various streaming platforms in terms of earnings and stream counts. Using this approach, unsigned musicians determine which instruments and genres perform the best in terms of streams and sales for their own discographies.

For the general audience, this project will be of significance for those interested in how streaming services convert streams into earnings.
